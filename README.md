# layoff.cleaning.sql
Hi everyone,

I am thrilled to share my very first project after diving into the world of MySQL: Data Cleaning with the Layoff Dataset. This project represents a significant milestone in my journey towards becoming a data scientist.

In this project, I tackled the task of cleaning a dataset containing information on layoffs. Through a series of data cleaning steps, I ensured the data is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

I hope you find this project insightful and useful. Stay tuned for more exciting projects as I continue to explore and grow in the field of data science.
